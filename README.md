### ‚úÖ Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis of Amazon product data using Excel Pivot Tables, here are five key recommendations to improve product performance, marketing, and engagement:

1. **Enhance Product Quality**  
   Study top-rated and high-review products to identify features that can be applied across the product line.

2. **Apply Smart Discounting**  
   Use discounts to drive sales, but avoid excessive markdowns that may reduce perceived product value.

3. **Target Marketing Around Bestsellers**  
   Allocate marketing budget to top-performing products and categories with high conversion potential.

4. **Boost Customer Engagement Through Reviews**  
   Encourage more reviews on lower-performing products through follow-ups, loyalty programs, or incentives.



### ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Limitations

This analysis provides valuable insights using available product and review data.  
While some fields are estimated (e.g., revenue), they offer useful directional guidance.  
Additional attributes like time trends or detailed categories could enhance future analysis.
